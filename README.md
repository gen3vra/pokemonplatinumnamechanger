# Pokemon Platinum Player Name Changer
## [Website Link](https://gen3vra.github.io/pokemonplatinumnamechanger/)

Simple website to generate an Action Replay code to change the player name in Pokemon Platinum. There may be some weird caveats like:
- Trainer ID or SID is not updated, so the name will not match the generated values from the game
- Pokemon may not listen to you after the name change as you are a different person (unless you have 8 badges)
